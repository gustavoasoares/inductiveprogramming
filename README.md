## Welcome to the inductive programming benchmark 

This repository contains useful benchmark and/or challenge problems to compare new and existing inductive programming systems under prefereably equal conditions with each other. If you have set of problems/scenarios where you think we could automate them by using inductive programming, please share them with us. 

## Getting start

The benchmark is organized in the following categories: 

* Data wrangling 
* Programming transformation

To add a new benchmark, create a subfoder in one of the current categories or create a new folder representing a new category. Add information about your benchmark in our [wiki page](../../wiki).
